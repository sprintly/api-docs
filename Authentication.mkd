## Introduction

Sprint.ly's API uses basic HTTP-Auth over SSL. The only difference is that you use your API key rather than your account's password as your password. You can find your API key on your [account profile](https://sprint.ly/account/profile/). Your username is your account's email address.

## Example

    curl -u joe@joestump.net:286755fad04869ca523320acce0dc6a4 https://sprint.ly/api/products.json
